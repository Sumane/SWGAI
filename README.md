# SWGAI
A project to create a an algorithm that can learn to play the MMO game Star Wars Galaxies

Star Wars Galaxies is an MMO that was released in 2003 and has since been emulated (SWGemu) due to its popularity. The purpose of this project is to experiment with the idea of creating a machine learning algorythm that can play and become proffficient at the game, through a use of both supervised and unsupervised learning.

The below steps will outline my ambitions for the project, in both near term and long term goals. I believe it is possible to create a bot that can interact with the game with minimal supervision, and achieve post-human levels of achievment, however the ambitions and realisations of the project will be determined by firstly my enthusiasm for the project, my ability to improve my own skills in machine learning, and any potential future collaboration with others in the project.

Step 1) Making sense of its environment.
The first step in creating a program that can comfortably traverse the world of Star Wars Galaxies, is to allow it to "see" what is going on, and process that information into usable data. Currently, I feel that the best way to achieve this is to use a "You Only Look Once" algorythm, to identify key features of the games display. Features such as the direction a player is moving, the current health status of the player, potential visible opportunities and risks, other players, and ability to interact with the games user interface. This particular part of the project will continue as the program learns more and more about the game, and will never be perfect, however once a certain level of recognition is learned, then we can proceed onto the next phase of development.

Step 2) Path Finding
Once the program is able to indentify key features in its environment, it now needs to learn to move and navigate that environment. To do this, a path finding algorythm will be needed. Similar to the previous step, once a basic level of understanding is met, we can move onto the next part of development process and this path finding can continue to be refined in the future. I do believe that developing a certain amount of immagination will be required, as there are certain paths that require an amount of problem solving, however this is long term.

Step 3) Interacting with the environment
Once a basic level of the first 2 steps are accomplished, the program will need to learn to have some form of interaction with its environment, firstly in terms of creatures and NPC's in the game. This will require 2 different learning processes, to develop. Firstly the program will need to learn basic combat mechanics of the game, and secondly to maximise productivity by gaining skills in the in-game skill tree, through purchase with experience. Both aspects of this level of interaction would now need to be further enhanced through trial and error over time, but once a basic understanding is met, further progress can be made.

Step 4) Enhancing current Levels of skill
At this point I cant decide on how to best proceed and feel that the only way to decide on the next step, would be to see how the project is going and revisit the progress at that point.
